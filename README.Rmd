indiedown allows you to generate a customized RMarkdown PDF template in a few basic steps.

Start by installing indiedown:

```r
install.packages("indiedown")
```

You can also install the development version from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cynkra/indiedown")
```

To create your own, customized RMarkdown template, start by creating an indiedown template package, called `mydown` in this example.
Navigate to the directory where you want to create the package, then:

```r
indiedown::create_indiedown_package("mydown")
```

This creates a package skeleton in the new `mydown` directory in the current working directory.
You can build *mydown*, using "Build and Reload" in the RStudio or via the command line, as follows:

```r
devtools::install("mydown")
```

With *mydown* built and installed, our new template is available in RStudio (after a restart).

Read more at `vignette("indiedown")`.
See `vignette("customize")` for how to customize your template.
