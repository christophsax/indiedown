# indiedown: Individual RMarkdown PDF Templates

indiedown makes it easy to generate a customized RMarkdown PDF templates that follow the principles of your corporate design.

Start by installing indiedown:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("cynkra/indiedown")
```

## Create an customized RMarkdown template

To create your own, customized RMarkdown template, start by creating an indiedown template package, called `mydown`:

```r
indiedown::create_indiedown_package("mydown")
```

This creates a package skeleton at `./mydown`. You can build build *mydown*, using 'build and reload' in the RStudio or via the command line, as folows:

```r
devtools::install("mydown")
```

With *mydown* built and installed, our new template is available in RStudio (after a restart):

## Apply custom modification at three entry points

indiedown does not modify the default `.tex` template of Pandoc. Instead, all modifications are applied on top of it.
This should make it compliant with future releases of Pandoc and RMarkdown.

There are three possible entry points to customize an indiedown skeleton:

- Set defaults (such as fonts or geometry) in the YAML header at `inst/indedown/default.ymal`

- Tweak LaTeX settings at `inst/indedown/pramble.tex`

- Apply dynamic adjustments in `pre_processor.R` (advanced)

See the `vignette("customize")` for details.


## Corporate Design Elements

Indiedown packages use R functions to generate LaTeX code for customization.

For most customizations, it is recommended to turn off the default LaTeX title page, and create your own title page via LaTeX commands. The basic repertory are the LaTeX commands `\large`, `\Large`, `\LARGE`, `\huge`, etc., along witch `vspace{1ex}`, but all LaTeX trickery can be applied. The LaTeX helper functions should be put to the `R` folder of your package.

The function `cd_page_title()` creates an example title page that can be adjusted to your needs. Note that the example uses raw strings, which are only available in R >= 4. They make it easy to write LaTeX code directly in R. See details in `?indiedown_glue` for methods that work well with R < 4.


## Principles of Indiedown

### Extend Pandoc .tex, do not substitute

indiedown does not modify the default `.tex` template of Pandoc. Instead, all modifications are applied on top of it.
This should make it compliant with future releases of Pandoc and RMarkdown.

### Write Keep Corporate Design Elements

Keep all corporate design elements as R code. This keeps the tex code simple and allows flexible extensions.
